This activity continues our sequence of learning [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

We will build a question-and-answer site, a very basic version of Stack Overflow.

For this lesson, you will:
- Write a back end with a REST API.
- Use multiple collections of data that are linked together.
- Test your back end using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).


Follow these parts:

* [Part 1](./part1.md): Questions
* [Part 2](./part2.md): Testing
* [Part 3](./part3.md): Answers
* [Part 4](./part4.md): More Testing
