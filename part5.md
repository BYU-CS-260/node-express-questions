# Part 5 - Front End

You can [download a front end](./src/front-end.zip) that will talk to the back end you built. Create a directory called `node-express-questions-front-end` and unzip `front-end.zip` in this directory. Then you can install the packages it needs:

```sh
npm install
```

You can run this front end with:

```sh
npm start
```

You now have a React front end for a a question-and-answer site. This could was created using `create-react-app`. Most of the relevant code is in `src/App.js` and the `components` directory.

The code is commented extensively to help you understand it.
